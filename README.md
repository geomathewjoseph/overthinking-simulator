## 💡 Origin Story

*"It's funny because it sounds exactly like you spiraling."* - My two best friends, calling me out.

This project was born out of a particularly chaotic few weeks in my personal life. I found myself spiraling over every little decision (should I send this text? does that emoji look passive-aggressive?), and somewhere in the middle of a 3 AM worrying session, I thought: *What if AI could do this for me? Could I automate my worst-case scenarios?*

It started as a joke. I built a quick prototype and showed it to my two best friends, expecting a chuckle. Instead, they laughed and told me it sounded exactly like me spiraling. (And yeah, lol, it is true). I shared it with a few more friends, and the reaction was unanimous - it wasn't just funny, it was painfully relatable.

That's when I realized the potential here. Our brains are often just being drama queens. By outsourcing that drama to an app, we can see these spirals for what they really are: hilarious, absurd, and usually completely unfounded.

This simulator is a lighthearted way to hold a mirror up to our own overthinking. If an app can do it better than we can, maybe we can laugh at the absurdity of it all and finally let go.

## ✨ What is this?

Ever wondered what happens inside an overthinker's brain? (Spoiler: It's loud). 

This simulator takes your simple yes/no decisions and transforms them into hilarious, relatable thought spirals that escalate from *"Should I get coffee?"* to *"What is the meaning of free will?"* in seconds. It uses AI to generate unique, context-aware anxiety loops so you don't have to make them yourself.

## 🧪 Example

**Input:** `Should I eat pizza for dinner?`

**AI-Generated Spiral:**
> 1. 🤔 "Pizza sounds good... but wait, is it healthy?"
> 2. 📊 "Let me calculate the exact caloric impact on my weekly average..."
> 3. 😰 "What if the delivery guy judges my order frequency?"
> 4. 🌍 "Is ordering delivery contributing to the collapse of society?"
> 5. 💀 "I should probably just not eat. Problem solved."
> 6. 🍕 *Orders pizza anyway*

## 🔐 Security

- API keys are **never exposed** to the client (locked deeper than a buried memory)
- All AI requests are proxied through Vercel serverless functions
- No user data is stored or tracked (what happens in the spiral, stays in the spiral)
